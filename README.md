# How to speed up the flow of work and increase quality and agility
## Tip #1: Make your work visible
Make issues visible so that they don't impact delivery or cost failures in the production environment.
- [ ] Use Kanban boards to visualize workflow.
- [ ] Represent tasks with physical or electronic cards.
- [ ] Track work from left to right on the board.
- [ ] Ensure work is only considered done when it reaches the right side and the application is running successfully.
## Tip #2: Limit work in progress
It limits the number of tasks performed by a team or an individual in each stage of a workflow, thereby reducing the work in progress and reducing multitasking.
- [ ] Set limits on the number of tasks performed by a team or individual at each stage of the workflow.
- [ ] Reduce multitasking by focusing on a few tasks at a time.
- [ ] Use tools like Kanban boards to manage work priorities and urgent requests.
## Tip #3: Reduce batch size
Improve workflow and quality and cutting down lead times.
- [ ] Make small code changes to version control.
- [ ] Test small code changes promptly.
- [ ] Get small code changes into production quickly.
- [ ] Focus on smaller changes to check quality and integration.
## Tip #4: Reduce the Number of Handoffs
Automate a majority of processes and make a single team responsible for delivering value to the customer directly
- [ ] Minimize context switching by reducing the number of handoffs.
- [ ] Automate a majority of processes.
- [ ] Make a single team responsible for delivering value to the customer directly.
## Tip 5: Eliminate Waste
- [ ] Identify and eliminate incomplete work.
- [ ] Remove unnecessary manual work.
- [ ] Streamline unnecessary processes and features.
- [ ] Avoid heroics that require constant firefighting.
- [ ] Focus on creating feedback and fast-forward loops to make work systems safe and resilient.
# Creating feedback and fast-forward loops to make work systems safe and resilient.
## Suggestion 1: Implement Telemetry and Observability
- [ ] Gather and transmit data from remote locations or machines to a centralized system.
- [ ] Use metrics to measure performance and response times.
- [ ] Apply observability concepts to understand and analyze systems better.
- [ ] Collect information about system performance, user behavior, network traffic, and other factors.
- [ ] Utilize telemetry to catch defects, quickly resolve them, and prevent recurrence.
## Suggestion 2: Swarm and Solve Problems
- [ ] Establish a system to identify issues quickly (e.g., Andon cord).
- [ ] Ensure that unresolved issues within a fixed time halt the production line.
- [ ] Unite the organization to fix issues collectively.
- [ ] Prevent the spread of problems to downstream work centers.
- [ ] Preserve critical information for diagnosing and treating problems upstream.
## Suggestion 3: Push Quality Closer to the Source
- [ ] Assign quality and safety responsibilities to developers engaged in the actual work.
- [ ] Encourage a bottom-up approach rather than waiting for top-down approval.
- [ ] Improve outcomes by empowering teams to take ownership of quality and safety.
- [ ] Foster a learning environment for teams to enhance their skills and knowledge.
## Suggestion 4: Optimize for Downstream Work Centers
- [ ] Focus on designing and optimizing operations for the next work center as the end customer.
- [ ] Consider the internal customer (next in line) as important as the external customer.
- [ ] Build quality proactively at every step of the value stream.
- [ ] Enhance operations to ensure smooth transitions and minimize disruptions for downstream work centers.
## Additional Steps for Creating a Blameless Work Culture
- [ ] Promote a work culture that builds trust and encourages experimentation.
- [ ] Create a blameless environment focusing on learning from successes and failures.
- [ ] Investigate accidents and issues without assigning blame.
- [ ] Address problems and failures before they impact the customer or cause major disruptions.
- [ ] Refer to organizational typology models for insights into managing complex systems and avoiding blame games.
